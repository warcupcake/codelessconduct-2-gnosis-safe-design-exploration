# Introduction

As part of the submission for Codeless Conduct Hackathon, held during February 23rd - March 9th 2022, this github repository shall contain the overview and content of the submission for "Codeless Conduct Bounty #2: Gnosis Safe Design Exploration" https://gitcoin.co/issue/gnosis/safe-hackathon/2/100027791.

# Objectives

The exploration of the design project is directed towards the improvement and addition of 2 specific aspects of the current Gnosis Safe product:
1. Gas Management: https://github.com/warcupcake/codelessconduct-2-gnosis-safe-design-exploration/blob/warcupcake-user-roles-and-policies-1/Gas%20Management.md#gnosis-safe-gas-management
2. User Roles and Policies: https://github.com/warcupcake/codelessconduct-2-gnosis-safe-design-exploration/blob/warcupcake-user-roles-and-policies-1/User%20Roles%20and%20Policies.md#gnosis-safe-user-roles-and-policies

For best reading experience, please start with **Gas Management**, then **User Roles and Policies**.

-----

Initially, the goal was to address the prompted applications of collective NFT and sign-in with Gnosis Safe user experience. However, with time constraints and a full-time employment, I decided to focus on originial contributions to improving Gnosis Safe in the form of the added Gas Management and User Roles features.

###### Thanks:

Thanks are owed to the Gnosis Safe and Codeless Conduct team for the opportunity to participate in the hackathon. Additionally, thanks to the team Contribution DAO for introducing the codeless conduct hackathon to me to experience first hand what it is like to contribute to a decentralized community.
